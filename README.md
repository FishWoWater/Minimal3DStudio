**Open3DStudio** is a 3D AIGC (AI Generated Content) application. It works closely with the [3DAIGC-API](https://github.com/FishWoWater/3DAIGC-API) to provide **completely locally deployed** and **free** 3DAIGC workflows, covering tasks like text-to-3d, image-to-3d, mesh segmentation, texture generation, auto-rigging, part completion etc.
