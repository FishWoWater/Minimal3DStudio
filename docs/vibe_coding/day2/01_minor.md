I am developing a 3DAIGC application in the current codebase and now have a number of requirements need your help.
1. The style of the topbar display is INCORRECT in electron application, there is no margin from the top edge and looks like distortion.
2. When creating a text-to-mesh task, the display in the task list (task entry card) should NOT include the user selected image 
3. current badge of the TaskType in the task entry card is a little bit too large 
4. bind X to deleting an object in keyboard shortcut registration
Make good plans before you begin, don't hold back and give it your all
