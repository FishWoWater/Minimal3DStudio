Now I need you to enhance the 3d viewport. Specifically, in the bottom bar there are a number of buttons , including scene tools like rotate/move/scale  scene objects around. I need you to support selecting objects in the scene and then apply these scene tools accordingly. Also there are buttons switching rendering modes (solid / wireframe / rendered), I need you to switch the material logics when these buttons are clicked or switched.
Make good plans before you begin, you are an expert and don't hold back, give it your BEST.
