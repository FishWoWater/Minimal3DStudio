In the current codebase I have already developed a minimal image-to-3d application (also with text2image support) upon Tripo API. Now I need you to add another API provider support `Replicate`. So that the user can switch between different API providers like Tripo and Replicate. 
1. Replicate also needs setting up an API Key (should also be configured in the settings panel)
2. Refer to @example_replicate_text2imahge.sh @example_replicate_image2model.sh for examples using replicate to send text2image and image-to-model requests, check the examples for input / output specifications
3. As you may already have seen on the API example, replicate image2model interface you SHOULD ONLY provide 2 advanced parameters: (1) texture_size: [512, 2048], (2) mesh_simplify: [0.5, 0.95].
4. Official replicate node.js doc: https://replicate.com/docs/get-started/nodejs
Notice that different API providers can have different advanced parameters supported. You code should be scalable and extensible and SHOUDN'T affect original tripo API logic.
